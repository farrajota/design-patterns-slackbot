# Design Patterns

List fo design patterns I've found that look promising to learn more about / take a look at.

| Event Sourcing | Use an append-only store to record the full series of events that describe actions taken on data in a domain. | [Data Management](data_management.md) [Performance Efficiency](performance_efficiency.md) |  |
| External Configuration Store | Move configuration information out of the application deployment package to a centralized location. | [Design And Implementation](design_and_implementation.md) [Operational Excellence](operational_excellence.md) | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/external-configuration-store#example) |
| Federated Identity | Delegate authentication to an external identity provider. | [Security](security.md) |  |
| Gatekeeper | Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance that acts as a broker between clients and the application or service, validates and sanitizes requests, and passes requests and data between them. | [Security](security.md) |  |
| Gateway Aggregation | Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. | [Design And Implementation](design_and_implementation.md) [Operational Excellence](operational_excellence.md) | [Nginx Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-aggregation#example) |
| Gateway Offloading | Offload shared or specialized service functionality to a gateway proxy. | [Design And Implementation](design_and_implementation.md) [Operational Excellence](operational_excellence.md) | [Nginx Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-offloading#example) |

| Priority Queue | Prioritize requests sent to services so that requests with a higher priority are received and processed more quickly than those with a lower priority. This pattern is useful in applications that offer different service level guarantees to individual clients. | [Messaging](messaging.md) [Performance Efficiency](performance_efficiency.md) | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/priority-queue#example) |
| Publisher/Subscriber | Enable an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers. | [Messaging](messaging.md) |  |

| Retry | Enable an application to handle transient failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource, by transparently retrying a failed operation.
