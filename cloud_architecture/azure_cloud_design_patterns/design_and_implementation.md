# Design And Implementation Patterns

| Pattern | Summary | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Ambassador](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/ambassador) | Create helper services that send network requests on behalf of a consumer service or application. |  |
| [Anti-Corruption Layer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/anti-corruption-layer) | Implement a fa√ßade or adapter layer between different subsystems that don't share the same semantics. |  |
| [Backends for Frontends](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/backends-for-frontends) | Create separate backend services to be consumed by specific frontend applications or interfaces. |  |
| [Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs) | Segregate operations that read data from operations that update data by using separate interfaces. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/cqrs#example) |
| [Compute Resource Consolidation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compute-resource-consolidation) | Consolidate multiple tasks or operations into a single computational unit. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compute-resource-consolidation#example) |
| [External Configuration Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/external-configuration-store) | Move configuration information out of the application deployment package to a centralized location. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/external-configuration-store#example) |
| [Gateway Aggregation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-aggregation) | Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request. | [Nginx Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-aggregation#example) |
| [Gateway Offloading](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-offloading) | Offload shared or specialized service functionality to a gateway proxy. | [Nginx Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-offloading#example) |
| [Gateway Routing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-routing) | Route requests to multiple services using a single endpoint. | [Nginx Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-routing#example) |
| [Leader Election](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election) | Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader that assumes responsibility for managing the other instances. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election#example) |
| [Pipes and Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) | Break down a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate elements that can be reused. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters#example) |
| [Sidecar](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) | Deploy components of an application into a separate process or container to provide isolation and encapsulation. |  |
| [Static Content Hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/static-content-hosting) | Deploy static content to a cloud-based storage service that can deliver them directly to the client. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/static-content-hosting#example) |
| [Strangler Fig](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler-fig) | Incrementally migrate a legacy system by gradually replacing specific pieces of functionality with new applications and services. |  |
