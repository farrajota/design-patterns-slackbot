| Gateway Routing | Route requests to multiple services using a single endpoint. | [Conf](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-routing#example) |
| Geodes | Deploy backend services into a set of geographical nodes, each of which can service any client request in any region. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry#example) |
