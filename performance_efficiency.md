# Performance Efficiency Patterns

| Pattern | Summary | Implementations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Priority Queue | Prioritize requests sent to services so that requests with a higher priority are received and processed more quickly than those with a lower priority. This pattern is useful in applications that offer different service level guarantees to individual clients. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/priority-queue#example) |
